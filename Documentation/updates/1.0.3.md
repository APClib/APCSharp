# Remaining

For this update, we added a bit more features than we changed. Actually this update is more focused on adding a missed feature that was removed when implementing the stream-based system. What you may ask? Well it's difficult to read the rest of the remaining data from a stream while keeping the previous index intact. Simply reading to the end of stream is easy, but what we added was support to fetch all remaining data how many times you'd like, simulating it as a single field on the `PResult` class as a string.

So how do I use it?
Well you simply call `.Remaining` on your parse result and *BAM*, there it is. Repeat the process until you get tired of it, you're welcome.

## But why?

Sure, it is a small and *simple* addition to the library. But what it provides to you developers is a great detail you would have missed. How do we know that you ask? Because when we tested our own product, *we* missed it.
