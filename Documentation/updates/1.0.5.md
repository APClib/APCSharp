# Go full circular

For this update, we added support for fully circular dependent parsers allowing parsers to be recursive. Refer to another parser indirectly. This allows circular compile-time dependency between parsers.

## Why?

It might be hard at first to come up with an idea of why this might be useful, but if you've ever written anything complex, you might have stumbled upon  recursion in context-free language grammars. Imagine a JSON parser, where objects contains key-value pairs of elements which in turn can be objects. In this case we have a recursive grammar.

## How did you solve left recursion?

This is a problem, even such a big problem that it is mentioned on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion#Removing_left_recursion). We have sadly set an upper bound on how many nested parser calls allowed (without a consecutive successful parse), to **500**. This is for example the limit on how many parentheses pairs that could be nested inside each other. If you happen to hit this limit, please tell us by filing an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/APClib/APCSharp/issues) and we'll raise it.

## How do I use it?

It's easy, just create an anonymous lambda generator function for your parser when you reference it.

```csharp
Parser p = null; // Must be initialized, not neccesarry if static member.
p = Parser.Char('(').FollowedBy(Parser.Ref(() => p)).FollowedBy(Parser.Char(')')).Flatten().Maybe();
//														^
//										Notice the reference to itself here.

p.Run("((((((()))))))"); // Recursion :D
