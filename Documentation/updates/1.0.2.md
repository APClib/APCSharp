# Abstractions

Abstractions, abstractions, abstractions and abstractions.

That's what we like here in our little object-oriented programming cave. Inheritance and polymorphism is a powerful tool that must be used with care, which is the reason for which we have re-written large parts (again) to make building parsers that directly produce the desired AST with objects of used defined classes easier, not only our good old' `Node`.

During this update, lots have changed. Let's just say that we had lots of code changed, but for the better, hopefully. The thing to take from this is mostly that you may not have to change anything in your code, but APC# will work a little differently behind the hood. This seems to be a reoccurring theme throughout our recent updates and is something we want to decrease, and focus more on building out the library for you.
