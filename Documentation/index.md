# Welcome!

**APC#** is *another parser combinator library* for building **flexible**, **lightweight** and **powerful** parsers in **C#**.

We design all APC parser libraries from scratch and with great care for developer experience. **APC#** is simple, safe, well documented, descriptive and user friendly error messages, fully customizable and fast.

The power comes from the declarative style of combinators, writing complex parsers in *just minutes* and a *few lines of code*, requiring no special tools to produce executable and release ready products. Parser combinators are more powerful than regular expressions, as they can parse a larger class of languages and are simpler and easier to use than *parser generators*.

You'll never need to doubt that the parser has some small bug or an edge-case you forgot in the design, we take care of that part. Skip the headache and *focus on the fun part*, designing parsers!
