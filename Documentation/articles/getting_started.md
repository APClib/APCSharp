# Getting Started

Welcome and thanks for being here, we're glad that you're interested in building your next parser with **APC#**!

## Install

APC# is embedded directly into your C# program, without the need for any additional tools or build-time code generation tasks.

Simply install it by clicking on *Dependencies > Manage NuGet Packages > Browse* and search for **APC#**.

*Or* type command below in your .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package APCSharp
```
